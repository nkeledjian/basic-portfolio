      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello World! Web/Software Developer in training here. During my teens, I built computers for friends
        and family, gaining experience with hardware/software installation, and some basic IT support. 
        During high school, I briefly experimented with Java, 3D modelling for video games, and was big into gaming and 
        creating electronic music. Through certain personal experiences, my path took me toward the field of 
        psychology, taking on an interest for cognition and related topics. 
        <p>
        Fast foward to the present, after taking a leap of faith training as a therapist, I realized my true interest
        is in cognitive research. Post graduate school, I have come full circle and am diving head first
        into tech!
