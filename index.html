    <p>Hello World! Web/Software Developer in training here. During my teens, I built computers for friends
      and family, gaining experience with hardware/software installation, and some basic IT support. 
      During high school, I briefly experimented with Java, 3D modelling for video games, and was big into gaming and 
      creating electronic music. Through certain personal experiences, my path took me toward the field of 
      psychology, taking on an interest for cognition and related topics.

    <p>Nonetheless, I took a leap of faith within the field and went to a clinical program to train as a therapist. Not long after, I opted to leave the program
      realizing my interests leaned more toward studying cognition. Fast foward to the present, post-graduate school, I have come full circle and am diving head first
      into tech!
